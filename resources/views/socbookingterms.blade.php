            <b>Bookings and Allotments</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fit India app offers free resources (cycles, T-shirts, and light refreshments) for events. All bookings are subject to availability and are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. When you book a resource, you agree to use it responsibly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because these items are free, no payment is required and no refunds or cancellation fees apply. However, if your plans change, please cancel your booking in advance so others can use the resource. Repeated no-shows or abuses may result in restrictions on your ability to make future bookings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will receive confirmation of your booking along with any details you need. Fit India reserves the right to cancel or modify bookings if any unforeseen circumstances arise.
