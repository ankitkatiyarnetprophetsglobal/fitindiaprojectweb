                    <p>Hon’ble Prime Minister has launched the Fit India Movement on 29th of August 2019 to promote
                      Fitness amongst all. While Fitness involves all aspects of life, the Fit India Movement focuses on
                      physical fitness of all to start with. Fit India is not a government program. Government’s role is
                      of a catalyst to involve all citizens to promote Fitness as a people’s movement.</p>
                    <p>Fit India aims at promoting physical fitness of all by inculcating a habit of fitness in all
                      citizens. Physical fitness can be achieved by developing a habit of spending 45 to 60 minutes
                      daily for physical activities viz. sports, walking, cycling, dancing, yogasan or any other form of
                      physical activity.</p>
                    <p><strong>MoYS has set up a Fit India Mission Office at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi in
                        partnership with CII.</strong> Fit India Mission solicits partnerships for promoting Fit India
                      Movement from interested organisations.</p>
