                      <p>Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has launched the <strong>FIT INDIA MOVEMENT</strong> on
                          29 Aug 2019 with a view to make Physical Fitness a way of life. <strong>FIT INDIA
                              MOVEMENT</strong> aims at behavioural changes – from sedentary lifestyle to
                          physically active way of day-to-day living. Fit India would be a success only when it
                          becomes a people’s movement. We have to play the role of a catalyst.</p>
                      <P>In the above background, the Fit India Mission encourages <strong>YOUTH CLUB</strong> to
                          motivate people to become part of <strong>FIT INDIA MOVEMENT</strong> by inculcating at
                          least 45-60 minutes of physical activities in their day to day lives, individuals and
                          Youth Club can undertake various efforts for their own health and well-being as well as
                          for the health and well-being of fellow Indians.</P>
