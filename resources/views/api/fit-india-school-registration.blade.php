                   <p>Hon’ble Prime Minister has launched the FIT INDIA Movement on 29th August 2019 With a view to make physical ﬁtness a way of life. <strong>FIT INDIA Movement </strong>aims at behavioural changes – from sedentary lifestyle to physically active way of day-to—day living. FIT INDIA would be a success only when it becomes a people’s movement. We have to play the role of a catalyst.</p>
                   <p>You would agree that ‘How to Live’ ought to be the ﬁrst pillar of formal education. This involves teaching and practicing the art of taking care of one’s body and health every day. Therefore, schools have to be the ﬁrst formal institution after home where physical ﬁtness is taught and practiced.</p>
                   <p>In the above background, the Fit India Mission has prepared a system of <strong>FIT INDIA SCHOOL Certification </strong>with simple and easy parameters as below:</p>
